## Workshop Context

To make a discovery with the client, you will meet with the client representatives (incl. CMO, Audience Programme Manager, Director of Privacy, Director of Operations). 

Based on the given scenario, you will need to do the following: 

1. Write discovery questions given the customer's current challenges.
2. Create/update the Point-of-View deck (pptx is in this repository) to create a presentation and pitch it to the customer representatives.
3. Use the Adobe demo assets provided, customize them and show the solution in action to the customer.

The whole presentation shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes and will be followed by a short 5 mins Q&A.
